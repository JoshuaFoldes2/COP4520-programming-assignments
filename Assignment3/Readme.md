The assignments MinotaurGift and MarsRover can be run by compiling in an IDE like Virtual Studio Code by opening the file in studio and clicking run and everything should execute normally

An alternative method is opening the command line to where the file is stored and then executing javac MinotaurGift.java and javac MarsRover.java then executing java MinotaurGift and java MarsRover

The program prints outputs to the terminal.

I also fashioned a MarsRover Ver2.  That isn't necessarily part of the submissions.  A classmate convinced me that I missed something in the assignment.  I liked
the code I made so rather than delete it, I left it there.  Its probably how this would work in the case that this was running on real time, but based on Juan's
explanation, the code I submitted is the way its supposed to run.
