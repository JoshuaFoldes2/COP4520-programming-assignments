# COP4520-programming-assignments
This is where my assignments will be stored for COP 4520

The assignments MinotaurMaze and MInotaurQueue can be run by compiling in an IDE like Virtual Studio Code by opening the file in studio and clicking run and everything should execute normally

An alternative method is opening the command line to where the file is stored and then executing javac MinotaurMaze.java and javac MInotaurQueue.java then executing java MinotaurMaze and java MInotaurQueue

The program prints outputs to the terminal.
