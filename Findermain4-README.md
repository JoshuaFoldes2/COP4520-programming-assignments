# COP4520-programming-assignments
This is where my assignments will be stored for COP 4520

The assignment Findermain4 can be run by compiling in an IDE like Virtual Studio Code by opening the file in studio and clicking run and everything should execute normally

An alternative method is opening the command line to where the file is stored and then executing javac Findermain4.java and then executing java Findermain4

In either case, a folder called output should be in the same folder as the java file and then a file called primes.txt should be inside

The program prints outputs to both the terminal and to this file so you can always check the terminal if the file doesn't print since they print the same thing.
